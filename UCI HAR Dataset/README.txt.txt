Welcome to my project. Pretty simple and straightforward. I've used base R and some 80 lines of code to take multiple 1000's x 100's datasets and squeezed them down into a slim 14220x4 data frame. 

The script nearly directly follows the instructions, except that step four occurs simultaneously with step 1 in my script. Or rather I think the original feature names were effectively descriptive given that there are ample data dictionaries that came with the original data set.

It should be pretty easy to read and follow.
